			I am an undergraduate student at University College London studying Computer Science (Year 2). 
			I have just finished my first year; 
			and so I have obtained certain experience of working with various programming languages, 
			managing a team of students from different courses on one project and dealing with algorithms and their efficiencies.
			
			<br> <br>
			My current aim is to apply those skills and knowledge to real-world issues and to find particular industry that interests me the most. 
			Additionally, I am interested in investing â€“ the field I am learning in my spare time.

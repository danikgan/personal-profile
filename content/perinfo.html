		I am an undergraduate student at University College London studying Computer Science (Year 2). 
		I have just finished my first year; 
		and so I have obtained certain experience of working with various programming languages, 
		managing a team of students from different courses on one project and dealing with algorithms and their efficiencies.
		
		<br> <br>
		My current aim is to apply those skills and knowledge to real-world issues and to find particular industry that interests me the most.
